# Faculty/Student Research Database Overview

Department faculty regularly engage in research and publish their results. They are often looking to work with other faculty and students, but it is difficult to keep track of what each person is working on and interests to find collaborators. A database application might help address this problem. If we were to store abstracts, keywords, etc. of each professor’sinterests, along with student interests, both students and fellow faculty could easily search the database to see if there are opportunities for collaboration. There could also be a portal for local high schools, media outlets, and other members of the public community to use the database to find speakers for current topics. In essence, we are talking about a digital library on a small scale.

## Project Requirements

- One database will be shared by all user types
- “Faculty” users will have the ability to insert, update, and delete their entries
- “Student” and “Public” users will have the ability to search and view all entries
